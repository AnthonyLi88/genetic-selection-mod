# Genetic Selection Mod
This Minecraft mod enhances the game by providing a more lifelike simulation of animal interaction and breeding. It introduces additional attributes and characteristics to existing Minecraft animals, enabling them to exhibit more realistic behaviors and interactions. Currently, in Minecraft 12.1, Horses can be bred to produce more desirable foals, with higher jump strength and speed. This mod expands on this feature, allowing players to breed other animals, in a similar way, to create offspring with specific traits and characteristics. 

Example:

In this scenario, **Horse 1** is `size: 1.5` and has `speed: 6`, but only has `health: 5`. We have another horse - **Horse 2** - that is `size: 1.1` and has `speed: 5`, but has `health: 12`, we can breed the two horses and have a result that has a good chance of having a desired trait of faster `speed` and possibly higher `health`, and `size` could vary.

This is in theory, and everything is random chance, but this mod operates on altering chance by our interference.

Besides modifying the basic properties of a mob, this mod will aim to add more properties that wouldnâ€™t be listed by Minecraft, like sizes of different body parts of a mob. This goes with our mission of full customization in our mod.
