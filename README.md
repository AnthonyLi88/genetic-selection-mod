#Genetic Selection Mod

The basic idea of this Minecraft mod is that we can modify the properties of each mob with full customization from breeding mobs. Breed two mobs with desirable traits (determined through the mob’s properties), the offspring has a chance of inheriting x trait.

Example:

In this scenario, Horse 1 is size: 1.5 and has speed: 6, but only has health: 5. We have another horse - Horse 2 - that is size: 1.1 and has speed: 5, but has health: 12, we can breed the two horses and have a result that has a good chance of having a desired trait of faster speed and possibly higher health, and size could vary.

This is in theory, and everything is random chance, but this mod operates on altering chance by our interference.

Besides modifying the basic properties of a mob, this mod will aim to add more properties that wouldn’t be listed by Minecraft, like sizes of different body parts of a mob. This goes with our mission of full customization in our mod.
