# Real World Natural selection
## Hardy-Weinberg frequency 
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle

The principle that states that in the absence of external selection factors, allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant over a large population size
 
* Let p and q be the frequency of an allele in a given population
* p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1

If p2 + 2pq + q2 does NOT equal to 1, evolution is occuring, and there are selection pressures happening. ie;
predators are evolving to be stronger, food scarcity, etc. The above equation can be used to “measure” evolution in a population and as a potential debugging tool if telemetry on allele frequency can be implemented.

## Genetic drift
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift 

Genetic drift is the change in the frequency of alleles due to chance. This Affects smaller populations the most.

## Effective population size
* https://www.uwyo.edu/dbmcd/molmark/lect07/lect7.html 

The number of a species needed to roughly match the progress of genetic drift as the wider population.

## Heritability
* https://www.britannica.com/science/heritability

The amount of observational variation found in a population that can be chalked up to genetics and not environmental differences.

* Let Vg be the variation in genotype
* Let Vp be the variation in phenotype
* Let H be the heritability estimate
* H2 = Vg / Vp

H will range from 0 to 1. If H = 0, there is no genetic variation. If H = 1, all variation is due to genetics.

## Selection differential 
* https://excellenceinbreeding.org/sites/default/files/manual/EiB_M2_Selection%20Intensity_26-10-20.pdf 

The Selection Differential is the difference between the mean trait value of the selected parents and the overall population mean.

## Response to selection
* https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/quantgen/qgen7.htm#:~:text=The%20selection%20response%20is%20how,heriability%20by%20the%20selection%20differntial. 

Response to Selection is the "gain" made when mating selected parents. It is found by multiplying heritability by selection differential.

## Selection intensity
* https://breedplan.une.edu.au/general/a-breedplan-guide-to-genetic-improvement/#:~:text=Selection%20Intensity%20(i),(see%20Figure%201%20below). 

The Selection Intensity is the difference in the average genetic value of the animals selected for breeding versus the average genetic value of all animals in the population from which they were selected.
## Inbreeding vs Outbreeding
### Inbreeding
Inbreeding makes the offspring susceptible to recessive genetic disease from increasing the chance that those who alleles can come together. Inbreeding results in lower genetic diversity, making populations vunerable to all the same things. An example would be the Cavendish Bananas, which are all effectively identical in terms of genetics. As a result, a virus that can kill one has the potential to make the breed extinct.

### Outbreeding
Outbreeding creates genetically diverse populations, which is ideal for fitness in a species. If done too far out, and two species with low genetic compatibility breed, the offspring could have reduced fitness. An example of this would be the Mule, a horse and donkey hybrid that cannot reproduce, which does not allow for it to pass of genes to offspring.
